# Computer Vision Snake Game

This is a computer vision-based snake game where the player controls the snake using hand or body movements tracked by a camera. The game leverages computer vision technology to provide an immersive and interactive gaming experience.

## Features

- Control the snake using hand or body gestures captured by the camera.
- Real-time computer vision algorithms track and interpret the player's movements.
- Navigate the snake around a grid-like game board.
- Collect food items to grow the snake longer.
- Avoid colliding with walls or the snake's own body to prevent game over.
